			<div class="flex">
				<div class="col-1 intro-disc about-us">
					<p>Axite was founded by former academic researchers out of frustration at how inefficient and wasteful the current university funding model is. Researchers collectively spend millions of hours a year writing 100-page grants, and only about 1 in 8 are accepted. Science is bogged down by bureaucracy, directly limiting the progress of the human race.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-1">
					<p>
						Our mission is to accelerate breakthroughs on the biggest challenges that face humanity today. The roadblocks are clear: government is slow, funding is limited, and results are opaque to most people. We want to open up scientific research and make it accessible to more people, to move forward faster.

								We are currently focused on two exceptionally important areas: longevity research and brain computer interfaces (BCI). We chose these areas by asking ourselves what humans of the 2040s might find barbaric and ancient about today. We want to make humans live healther, happier, longer, and more convenient lives. We are constantly on the lookout for promising research areas and labs. Find out more about each area and the labs working in them below.

 Professor Sessler fought recurrent Hodgkin's lymphoma while completing his Ph.D. in anti-cancer research at Stanford. He founded Pharmacyclics to create new cancer drugs, acquired for $21 billion by AbbVie in 2015. Professor Sessler has 75 patents and was named UT Austin's inventor of the year in 2016.

												<h3>Why we chose this lab</h3>
												<p>
 An important part of enabling humans to live longer and happier lives is beating cancer. Very few researchers have made contributions to the anti-cancer battle as much as Professor Sessler, who has fought cancer as a researcher, patient, and entrepreneur. The Sessler Group continues to work on the cutting-edge of designer drugs to beat cancer. Steinbruck's work on anti-plaque molecules also has potential implications for treating Alzheimer's and related diseases.

									<p>
										BCI (brain computer interface) research seeks to understand how the brain computes and build devices to write and read from it. With BCI, we can create better bionic limbs for amputees, let the blind see, and enable higher-bandwidth links to your computer, Google Assistant, or the Internet. BCIs will likely become the de-facto way humans of the future interact with technology.
