											<h3>At a glance</h3>
											<p>
											Professor Sessler fought recurrent Hodgkin's lymphoma while completing his Ph.D. in anti-cancer research at Stanford. He founded Pharmacyclics to create new cancer drugs, acquired for $21 billion by AbbVie in 2015. Professor Sessler has 75 patents and was named UT Austin's inventor of the year in 2016.</p>
											<br><br>

											<h3>Why we chose this lab</h3>
											<p>
												An important part of enabling humans to live longer and happier lives is beating cancer. Very few researchers have made contributions to the anti-cancer battle as much as Professor Sessler, who has fought cancer as a researcher, patient, and entrepreneur. The Sessler Group continues to work on the cutting-edge of designer drugs to beat cancer. Steinbruck's work on anti-plaque molecules also has potential implications for treating Alzheimer's and related diseases.

								<p><b>What is BCI Research?</b></p>

								<p>
									BCI (brain computer interface) research seeks to understand how the brain computes and build devices to write and read from it. With BCI, we can create better bionic limbs for amputees, let the blind see, and enable higher-bandwidth links to your computer, Google Assistant, or the Internet. BCIs will likely become the de-facto way humans of the future interact with computers.

					Axite Labs puts 20% of each contribution back into growing our operation. This includes getting the word out and making it easy and interesting for everyone to understand complex research. 
					<br><br>
					You probably found us today through a friend or maybe even through preliminary ads we are testing, but if we are serious about getting everyone onboard to build the future sooner, we will need to launch marketing campaigns to grow. And even if you hear about us, if you don't know what our researchers are working on, how would you know if its useful and why would you ever want to fund it? We're impact-driven, and we firmly believe reinvesting 20% of your donation will have an exponential effect on our future impact on the field.
